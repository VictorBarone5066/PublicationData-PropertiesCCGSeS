WARNING: You are using a fully symmetrized k-point grid. If you don't know what that means
WARNING: stop here and check the manual. Please Prepare a k-point grid that spans EITHER the whole
WARNING: Brillouin zone (i.e. without symmetry) or half of the Brillouin zone 
WARNING: (i.e. only time reversal symmetry) and restart your quantum-mechanical calculation
WARNING: and try again!

INFO: There are more PAW bands than local basis functions available.
INFO: To prevent trouble in orthonormalization and Hamiltonian reconstruction
INFO: the PAW bands from 77 and upwards will be ignored.
